Fine-Tuning Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on a Medical Dataset

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on a medical dataset using LoRA fine-tuning.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

ðŸ”¹ 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have all required Python libraries installed:

pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸ”¹ 2. Fine-Tune the Model from Scratch

Run the following command to train the model using your dataset:

python main.py

ðŸ“Œ This script will:

âœ… Load the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model

âœ… Load and preprocess the medical dataset

âœ… Apply LoRA fine-tuning

âœ… Save the trained model in Medical/final/

ðŸ”¹ 3. Resume Training from a Checkpoint

If you previously trained the model and want to continue training, run:

python train_from_checkpoint.py

ðŸ“Œ This script will:

âœ… Load the last saved model from Medical/final/

âœ… Resume training with the same dataset and parameters

âœ… Save the updated model to the same directory

ðŸ”¹ 4. Run Inference (Chat with the Model)

Once the model is trained, you can test it by running:

python inference.py

ðŸ“Œ This script will:

âœ… Load the fine-tuned model from Medical/final/

âœ… Accept a medical question as input

âœ… Generate a response using the chatbot

âœ… Print the result to the console
