ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
ðŸ”¹ 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have all required Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
ðŸ”¹ 2. Fine-Tune the Model from Scratch
Run the following command to train the model using your dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
ðŸ“Œ This script will:
âœ… Load the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model
âœ… Load and preprocess the medical dataset
âœ… Apply LoRA fine-tuning
âœ… Save the trained model in Medical/final/

ðŸ”¹ 3. Resume Training from a Checkpoint
If you previously trained the model and want to continue training, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_from_checkpoint.py
ðŸ“Œ This script will:
âœ… Load the last saved model from Medical/final/
âœ… Resume training with the same dataset and parameters
âœ… Save the updated model to the same directory

ðŸ”¹ 4. Run Inference (Chat with the Model)
Once the model is trained, you can test it by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
python inference.py
ðŸ“Œ This script will:
âœ… Load the fine-tuned model from Medical/final/
âœ… Accept a medical question as input
âœ… Generate a response using the chatbot
âœ… Print the result to the console
