Fine-Tuning Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on a Medical Dataset

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on a medical dataset using LoRA fine-tuning.

🚀 How to Run the Project

🔹 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have all the required Python libraries installed. Run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🔹 2. Fine-Tune the Model from Scratch

To train the model using your dataset, execute:

python main.py

📌 This script will:
✅ Load the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model✅ Load and preprocess the medical dataset✅ Apply LoRA fine-tuning✅ Save the trained model in Medical/final/

🔹 3. Resume Training from a Checkpoint

If you previously trained the model and want to continue training, run:

python train_from_checkpoint.py

📌 This script will:
✅ Load the last saved model from Medical/final/✅ Resume training with the same dataset and parameters✅ Save the updated model to the same directory

🔹 4. Run Inference (Chat with the Model)

Once the model is trained, you can test it by running:

python inference.py

📌 This script will:
✅ Load the fine-tuned model from Medical/final/✅ Accept a medical question as input✅ Generate a response using the chatbot✅ Print the result to the console
